My name is Jingyu Guo. I am a full time professional working in biotech in San Francisco Bay Area.

I worked on translational studies with yeast cell model at University of Alabama at Birmingham. Thus naturally I enjoy beer.

I am working in translational/medical genetics and bioinformatics. I am also working on machine learning. Therefore natually I enjoy coding and understanding from data.

My passion lies in the interdisciplinary fields of biology and computer sciences. I'm available for exciting opportunies working with people who share the same passion.
