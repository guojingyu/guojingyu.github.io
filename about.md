My name is Jingyu Guo. I am a full time professional working in biotech in San Francisco Bay Area.

I worked on translational biomedical research with yeast cell model. Thus naturally I enjoy beer. I studied computer sciences and have a craving for machine learning. Therefore natually I enjoy coding and understanding from data.

I am currently working in translational/medical genetics and bioinformatics. My passion is to bring quantitative understanding and practices in biomedicine and healthcare. I would love to talk with people who share the same passion.
