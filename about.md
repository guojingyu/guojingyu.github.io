My name is Jingyu Guo. I am a full time professional working in biotech in San Francisco Bay Area.

I worked on translational biomedical research with yeast cell model at University of Alabama at Birmingham. Thus naturally I enjoy beer. I studied computer sciences at Georgia Institute of Techology and have a passion about machine learning. Therefore natually I enjoy coding and understanding from data.

I am currently working in translational/medical genetics and bioinformatics. My passion lies in the interdisciplinary fields of biology and computer sciences. I'm available for exciting opportunies working with people who share the same passion.
